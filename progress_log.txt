First I created rough versions of classes Grid, Position, Direction and Game.
Started fiddling with swing, decided to use scalafx instead because course material had good tutorials on the subject.
Then I focused on getiing something, anything showing up on the GUI.
Had a problem with using match for Tiles, solved the problem by overriding each subclasses toString method and using match on toString ie. tile.toString match
I decided to use a GridPane for the GUI.
Also got a gameview with game elements showing on the screen when running GUI.
Time used ~10h maybe a bit more.

Game logic implemented into the gui. First I made it so that the gui tracks and updates the Game class's players location, and before moving the player, the game checks if it's possible.
First task was to make a method to Game that checks if the player is allowed to move in a direction (canMove).
Then little by little, all game logic was added to the gui. All game elements are now working as intended.
After that, I started to look for sprites for the game. I found cool player sprites that were free to use in a sprite hosting website.
Also I made a sprite for Bridge and added that to the project.
Then I made the gui so that it loads the sprites, and adds them to the scene.
Time used today ~3 hours.
